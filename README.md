- Make sure you use `python` or `python3` to run the application in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

### Linux/macOS
- On Linux and macOS, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python` to run the application.
- Terminal environments on Linux/macOS support ANSI escape codes, so the green text should work without issue.
